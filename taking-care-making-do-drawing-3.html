                        After months of threatening to fall, part of the fence at the front of the property finally
                        collapsed during a storm in 2022. We partially disassembled the broken section and put it to one side. The gap became an
                        extra space for cars to drive through and park, freeing up part of the driveway for other uses. The cars driving
                        through this space exacerbated the already cracked concrete. Plants and flowers began to grow up through the
                        widening gaps. Opportunity from failure.

                        A patch of bamboo behind the carport has been growing wild for many years, despite multiple
                        attempts to tame it. Recognising its potential for a future project, we harvested eight tall
                        trees and cut them into 2.5 metre lengths. On discovering the strange beauty of this forgotten
                        spot, we crafted a table from the remaining stumps and leftover timber fencing and ate lunch
                        down amongst the bamboo.

                        In 2028 the timber floor of the carport began to rot and break away. Bamboo began to grow up
                        through the gaps. Remembering the joy of eating amongst the trees, we placed a couple of
                        chairs on the least damaged parts. A friend strung up a hammock. By 2031 the floor had
                        completely rotted away. The addition of a few partially finished walls and a light roof thrown
                        over the trimmed bamboo made an extra summer bedroom.
