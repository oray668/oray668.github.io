                    What if our democratic system better reflected the complexity and great creative potential of
                        human cohabitation?
                        What if it was powered by the imaginations and dreams of the population?
                    <br /><br />
                    In this project, a process of explorative drawing sought to speculate on the potential of the
                    imagination in a
                    democratic system. The Beehive was imagined as an empty vessel within which infinite possibilities
                    existed, and then
                    tangents were followed, and ideas generated through a parallel practice of drawing and note-taking.
                    The drawings imagine
                    a world where widespread cultural production is normalised and stimulates a sense of empowerment in
                    a way that our
                    current democratic system does not.
                    <br /><br />
                    The Cloud Democracy is a finely distributed network through which the citizen can become architect,
                    and their hopes for
                    the country materialised and made tangible in order to both make change and inspire future
                    change.The Cloud is an
                    endless world where the imaginations and dreams of the country are recorded, a collective
                    imagination. The voting system
                    is replaced with a process of ‘cloud-gazing’ that facilitates the upload of imaginations to the
                    Cloud. Individual ideas
                    that would otherwise have little likelihood for change are given space to develop and interact with
                    others, growing in
                    potential. The dream constructions of the Cloud are then downloaded into the real world, tested
                    directly in the areas
                    they are needed. Walls are erected, then breached. A house expands to admit the houseless. Safe
                    passage is assured for
                    school children underneath a plucked up road.
                    <br /><br />
                    A network of dreams spans both the real and the imagined world. Strolling the streets would reveal
                    the hopes and spatial
                    speculations of your neighbours and small acts of creativity would inspire larger ones to make real
                    change.
